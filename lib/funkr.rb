# Funkr brings some common functional programming constructs to ruby.
#
# In particular, it offers a simple mechanism to create Algebra√Øc Data
# Types and do pattern matching on them. For an exemple
# implementation, {Funkr::Types see provided classes}.
#
# It also provide modules for common categories (Monoid, Monad,
# Functor, Applicative ...), and extends common types to support
# categories they belongs to (Array, Hash ...). Categories can also be
# used with custom types, {Funkr::Types see provided classes}.
