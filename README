Funkr brings some common functional programming constructs to ruby.

In particular, it offers a simple mechanism to create Algebra√Øc Data
Types and do pattern matching on them. For an exemple
implementation, see provided classes.

It also provide modules for common categories (Monoid, Monad,
Functor, Applicative ...), and extends common types to support
categories they belongs to (Array, Hash ...). Categories can also be
used with custom types,  see provided classes.

To get started, we recommand you to read the tests, and get feets wet
with provided Algebraic Data Types (like Maybe).
